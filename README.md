# Road_Accident_Dashboard

• Developed a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard in Excel to analyze data from 2021, 2022 and 2023. 

• The dashboard aimed to provide insights into various aspects of road accidents, helping clients understand patterns and identify critical areas for improvement.

• The primary focus was on key performance indicators (KPIs), such as total casualties and the percentage of casualties concerning accident severity. 

• The dashboard highlighted maximum casualties by vehicle type, road type, and surface conditions.

• The dashboard included a monthly trend analysis to compare casualties between the current and previous years, allowing for a clear visual representation of changes over time. 

• It also explored the relationship between casualties and factors like area/location, time of day (day/night), and road conditions.
